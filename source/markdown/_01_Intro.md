For five years I have been a recluse. I don't leave the house for months at a time [^severity]. I venture out into the world only when it is necessary to maintain my isolation. I'm not agoraphobic, I'm not depressed, and I'm not insane [^psychosis]. I simply don't socialize. 

There are a lot of names for people like me. We are called shut-ins, hermits, recluses and so on. These words mean different things depending on what media you have been exposed to. To some, a hermit is a monastic human living high in the Himalayas connecting with his inner self through meditation and isolation. Some picture a crazy, bearded, old fellow, cooking up whiskey deep in the Appalachian wilderness. Some picture a Howard Hughes type, they imagine man that harvests his fignernails and wears tinfoil hats to keep the aliens out.  

Preconceptions are a difficult thing to overcome. The meanings we assume of words are our biggest obstacle to communication. Instead of fighting an uphill battle against meanings, let us leave the words we know behind and introduce a new one. 

*Hikikomori* is a Japanese word which means "pulling inward". It has been used as a label to describe an emerging phenomenon in Japan, that of adolescents withdrawing from the world. We aren't going to stick to any hard definitions of _hikikimori_. Instead, we are going to use it only as a convenient placeholder to refer to a spectrum of individuals similar to, but not necessarily, like me. 

The label will be used as a tool in uncovering meaning, it wont be the meaning; meaning is not a label. Set aside any biases, hold back any prejudices and save judgment for later. We can always figure out how to flame me later. Complimentary rocks and pitchforks will be provided next to the comment section.

You don't just get up one day and say _"Fuck it, people suck. I'm not going out anymore"_. It's not that you cant do that, believe me, there are people that can and do, it's just that the world wont let you. If you just quit the world immediately, without any warning, then the world freaks out; a million text messages will be sent, cops will be called to check on you, interventions will be held, walruses will be dispatched on rescue scooters. Well not that last one, but I have to keep you, the reader, on your toes. 

In the aftermath of emotional implosion; friends, family, colleagues and even strangers will metamorph into an invasive species from planet Concern.

> You okay?

> Want me to come over?

> Is there anything I can do?

> Just let me know man.

> We are here for you.

> Remember we are all in this together.

Parents will interrogate you about your vitamin intake and whether you are getting enough exercise. 

> You know Uncle Mike swears by the root of the igaawoo tree. Have you looked into it? They have some of it at that shop... Hmm, what is the name of it again? It's right next to the subway.

> MIKE! Which subway is the igaawoo tree on?
 
Uncle Mike:
> What are you talking about?
  
Aunt Sharon:
> You know that root thingy? The store you get it from?
  
Uncle Mike (laughing):
> Honey, I was joking. That was Marijuana.
  
(awkward 15.345 seconds of silence)

Aunt Sharon:
> Have you tried vitAH-men C?

You'll be smothered by so much attention and help that eventually you might actually want to kill yourself [^overconcerned]. 

I have never emotionally imploded but I imagine it's much like a Californication episode or one of those coming of age novels where the depressed protagonist loves that girl but that girl doesn't love him so he like is all sad about unrequited love so he gets really down and does something stupid like take a lot of pills and try to ride his bike [^bikeriding] and then through a series of unlikely events he meets this manic pixie dream girl let's call her Sam and she is like all kinds of adorkable and she has them anime eyes and she has this friend Garry that is a little bit Autistic and he thinks the whole world is actually just a run-on story on a collision course with a period and if they don't act exactly like the teenager writing style trope they will all die and the protagonist is taught how to live and falls in love and they.

The point is that you cant just up and quit the world. To leave the world completely one has to cut ties slowly and steadily. You have to tug, warp, twist and tear at your connections until they're stressed enough to break. It takes systematic and conscious effort to leave the world.

It takes a _"special"_ type of person to be willing to be push everything and everyone away until nothing is left. To understand how I became such a "special" person, we have to start at my beginning. This is the story of how I faded from the world.

## Footnotes

[^severity]:
  There are occasions when I have needed to leave the house in rapid succession, but averaging things out over a year, I tend to get out about 8-12 times a year. There have been years when I have gone 5-6 months without leaving the house even once.

[^psychosis]:
  Clinically, my behavior would be defined as a "personality disorder". Medically speaking, insanity can be defined as something that violates social norms, which is loosely the definition of a personality disorder.
  However, in everyday usage "insanity" typically refers to "psychotic" behaviors. Please don't get caught up in the semantics though; language is about communication, not semantics.

[^overconcerned]: 
  Over concerned humans must cause at least some percentage of suicides. Someone needs to compile the stats and do a TED talk stat. 
  
[^bikeriding]:
  A very dangerous activity. Do not drink and bike!

[^statenotanassole]: 
  On a serious note I'd like to briefly state that this is a positive aspect of society. I'm in no way advocating you leave depressed people alone, just that you give them gentle space and not smother them. But don't take my word for it, ask depressed people how they feel.
