## Hey there Idaho. 

I didn't attend kindergarten until I was six [^cahomeschooling]. My first day started with excitement and curiosity; but also much anxiety. I had many questions but few answers. Why do kids go to school? Cant I just learn this on my own? Why cant my mom go with me? Can I bring a doll [^dolls] or stuffed animal? Will I have to talk to people?

Despite my worries, I still anticipated the day with excitement. When the time came, I ventured forth into the school with determination and I imagine much swagger. Then I ran out of the building screaming. I had to be forced to stay. I never was a difficult child, so the extent of said "force" was to walk me back inside. I stayed.

I had no idea how I was going to get through this five days a week. This unrelenting hell of noisy and stupid five year olds. 

> A is for Apple.

There is a picture of an Apple right there on the wall next to the "A". Surely we all know what an A looks like? 

> A is for igloo

> A is for umm...

*facepalm* I thought, I'm six, I'm too old for this shit. Only with less french. At the time I knew a bit of french, but discovered that adults didn't allow children to speak french. I imagined this was due to some sort of secret privileges adults acquired by initiation rights run by Barney [^barneyilluminati]. All hail the Free Barney Masons!

Peace came a few hours later when the teacher finally became fed up with the children and escorted them outside, where I imagined they would be re-educated and learn to act like civilized educated humans. I thought, "thank god" finally this teacher realizes these children don't belong here. Now we can get some actual learning done. 

I want to learn how they make those cubbies. I wonder, how do they get the plastic rods through the wood? It must take a particularly strong human. I mean, I cant even budge them. Do they have a specially designed human for this job? Doesn't look too hard. I bet with some proper training I could do it. I wondered if they would hire me.

Teacher:
> Kenny, don't you want to go out and play?

I found this question absolutely silly. Outside was where the noisy kids just went. Why in the world would I follow them? Outside wasn't even limited to the children from this classroom, outside was populated by an undetermined number of classrooms. I mean, there must be like 100 kids out there, perhaps thousands. Yeah, no fucking way. If going outside to play was so enjoyable then why was she inside. 

It was possible the other classrooms possessed quiet children and these children had become annoyed by our classrooms populace. Perhaps taking it upon themselves to murder our classroom and wipe the scourge of them from the face of the planet; but I wasn't taken any chances getting caught in the crossfire of an epic school battleground. If Saturday morning cartoons had taught me anything it was that schoolground battles could quickly get out of hand. No way was I going out there.

She informed me that during recess all the kids went out to play. I informed her that this was nice and that this was exactly why I was staying inside. 

Teacher:
> "Kenny, I think you'd like playing outside."

I thought, I can do this... I can kick her in the shin. I'll tell her _"if it's so nice outside then she should play outside"_. That will put her in her place. And while I'm at it I'll demand SNACKS and that NO ONE be allowed within two feet of my personal space or they will be thrown into a Mortal Kombat arena where they will fight to the death. Come on Kenny, stand up for yourself! 

Just imagine you are Kevin Sorbo and she is that evil triple headed dragon. Don't look her in the eyes! That is how she turns you to stone! Close your eyes and just go for it! 

I went outside. Every recess for the rest of the year I went outside.

I spent the next school year avoiding my one school "friend", a hyperactive kid that managed to injure himself for my entertainment at least twice. I'd like to think he went on to star on some MTV show and made millions injuring himself. Most likely though, he ended up working at MCDonalds and every Friday he gets drunk and drag races his idiot friend Stan.

All through that schoolyear I became thoroughly aware that I was different. My mom did too. That would be the last and only year I attended a public school. I was homeschooled until highschool, at which point I enrolled in a distance education charter school.

## Footnotes

[^cahomeschooling]: 
  Not technically true as I had some homeschooling in CA; and given CA's strict homeschool laws this required some sort of monitoring. I have vague memories of going to a school and being completely uninterested in some teacher whose face I cant remember, except only enough to tell you that she was frightening plain. The kinda of bland face you expect to find in a Peanuts cartoon. She had a vague replica of a human face, endless and thoughtless, yet still, somehow there. It was like she was an Android or a body snatched human.

[^dolls]: 
  At the time I had no idea that this was one of the reasons for my rejection by society. I dropped the dolls fairly quickly when I realized they were a girl thing. No one had properly informed me of these things. Thanks mom.
  
[^barneyilluminati]: 
  No, I'm not joking. I seriously believed that adults were members of a secret society and that Barney was somehow involved. The privileges included but were not limited to complete access to come and go from the north pole. I had plans to somehow convince Barney I could be a leader in their society due to my intelligence. For many years I had a speech prepared in case of a chance encounter with Barney. I could convince him I was worthy damnit. When a kid informed me that Barney was a girl it only served to re-inforce my belief in the conspiracy.
