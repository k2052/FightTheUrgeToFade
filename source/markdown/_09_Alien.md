## I think I might be an Alien.

During my twelfth year I developed an intense interest in anomalous and fringe science. Books by the likes of Graham Hancock, Charles Fort, Charles Berlitz, Michael Cremo and Whitley Strieber were strung across my floor for months on end. I devoured every weird book I could get my hands on. If it was strange, chances are I had read it. It wasn't long before I discovered a popular conspiracy theory espousing the idea that Alien abductions were a breeding project. 

At the time I was grappling with the realization that I wasn't Neurotypical.I had realized from a young age that my interests weren't mainstream but I had assumed that internally, everyone was similar to me, they just hadn't discovered the wonders of chess, checkers, life, the universe and everything.

To my horror I begin to discover that even those with similar interests weren't like me. A typical conversation would go like this:

Me:
> You like science books!!?"

> Which one did you read yesterday? 

Him:
> Yesterday? I like Carl Sagan. I've read Cosmos. A Brief History In Time is awesome!

Me:
> How many books on science have you read?

Him:
> Like dozens! I love the stuff!

Me:
> Per week? I can barely get through 5 a week.
  
Him: 
> No. Like total.
  
I wrote most of these incidences off as the result of people that weren't truly interested in the subject. I mean, if you like something, then you spend every waking moment on it right? These humans were fakers and pretenders. I just had to find someone that was actually interested in what I was interested in and they'd be as equally obsessive. I gradually discovered that my obsessive special interests were not normal. Neurotypical people do not spend every waking moment studying the thing they love.

Gradually I begin to realize that I was a freak even among the freaks. I felt so alone and isolated. Where did I fit in? Where were the humans that were like me? Are there even any humans like me? What the fuck was I? 

Believing I was an Alien was a natural conclusion for someone that continually failed to find a place to belong. Concluding I was an Alien was yet another way my identity as an outsider was re-inforced. No wonder I couldn't relate to humans, we weren't even the same damn species.

[^notalien]: 
  It was only as I became more active on the internet that I discovered I wasn't alone, that I wasn't an Alien. Intriguingly, I'd discover that many fellow members of my sub-species also felt like they were Aliens at one time or another. It's a pretty typical feeling for non-NTs to feel alien.
